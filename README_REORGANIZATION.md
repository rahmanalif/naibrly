## 🚀 How to Use Your Reorganized Project

### Starting the Development Server

```bash
cd C:\Users\rahma\Desktop\naibrly
npm run dev
```

### Using the New Constants

```javascript
// OLD WAY (Don't do this anymore)
router.push('/Login');
localStorage.setItem('auth_token', token);

// NEW WAY (Much better!)
import { ROUTES, STORAGE_KEYS } from '@/lib/constants';
router.push(ROUTES.LOGIN);
localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEYS.AUTH_TOKEN, token);
```

### Accessing New Documentation

All documentation is in the root folder:
- Read `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for complete structure details
- Check `REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` for list of changes
- View `STRUCTURE_COMPARISON.md` for before/after comparison

---

## 🔗 URL Changes

If you had bookmarks or links, update them:

| Old URL | New URL |
|---------|---------|
| `/repaires&Maintanens` | `/repairs-and-maintenance` |
| `/Tearmsanduse` | `/terms-of-use` |
| `/Bussniess` | `/business` |

## 💡 Best Practices Going Forward

### Naming Conventions

**Files:**
- Components: `PascalCase.jsx` (e.g., `UserProfile.jsx`)
- Utilities: `camelCase.js` (e.g., `formatDate.js`)

**Folders:**
- Feature folders: `kebab-case` (e.g., `landing-page/`)
- Routes: `kebab-case` (e.g., `terms-of-use/`)

**Code:**
- Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `function UserCard()`)
- Functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `function formatPrice()`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS`)

### Adding New Features

1. Create components in appropriate folder
2. Add routes in `app/` directory
3. Add constants to `lib/constants.js`
4. Create custom hooks in `hooks/` if needed
5. Update documentation

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Verify everything works:

- [ ] Run `npm run dev` - starts without errors
- [ ] Visit homepage - loads correctly
- [ ] Test navigation - all links work
- [ ] Check mobile view - responsive design works
- [ ] Test login flow - authentication works
- [ ] Open modals - all modals function
- [ ] Check console - no errors
